# Puppy-Simulator-
Launch it in your terminal! or in VSCODE any is fine really and put it in a seperated file so its all clean! id recommend naming the file TestingFolder as the one you are putting it in but any should be fine really. also to run a python file you either do py (name of your script (eg. Puppy-Simulator.py) ) or python3 (name of your script (eg. Puppy-Simulator.py) )

Also Quick Note: INSTALL COLORAMA FIRST
How to install VIA Terminal (no other way)
do 
python3 -m pip install colorama
or if that doesnt work
py -m pip install colorama
or
pip install colorama
after that then run the file

and if you are wondering colorama just changed the text of the output so it looks better and you can see it more clearly
anyways have fun! i will be updating this regularly
